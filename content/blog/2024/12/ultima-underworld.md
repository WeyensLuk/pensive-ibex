[Wouter](https://brainbaking.com) roped me into playing Ultima Underworld. It's the [DOS Game Club](https://www.dosgameclub.com/) of the months december, january and february. I haven't played any Ultima game before. So now, here I am, playing a DOS game on a Linux machine. Oh how turns have tabled.

I had to do a little tweaking, I installed the [hack](https://johnglassmyer.github.io/UltimaHacks/patcher-site/) for easier movement in the game. Then [PCGamingWiki](https://www.pcgamingwiki.com/wiki/Ultima_Underworld:_The_Stygian_Abyss#Piano_footstep_sounds) helped me fix my sound in-game (by installing Sound Blaster Pro).

After that it was smooth sailing. If you're interested in joining me on my journey through the Stygian Abyss you can find a narrated playthrough [right here](/ultima-underworld/).
