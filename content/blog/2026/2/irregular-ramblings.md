I see everyone doing weeknotes or monthly recaps, and I want in. Except, I don't want to tie myself down to a weekly or monthly format, so instead, these kind of posts will just appear randomly whenever I feel I have something to say. This will just be some sort of freeform rambling. I want to lower the bar as much as I can for myself, to just write these things and talk about stuff I've done, without paying too much attention to sentence structures or word count.

### Hard 75
A colleague of mine talked me into starting one of those Hard 75 challenges. The rules for this one are as follows:
1. Write your goals down every morning
2. Lift at least 3 days a week
3. Track every workout
4. Progress every session in some way
5. Walk at least 8000 steps a day
6. Follow a clean diet (no junkfood, sweeteners, cheat meals, alcohol)
7. Only drink water, black coffee, tea, coconut water or fresh made juice
8. Progress picture once a week
9. Sleep at least 7 hours a day
10. Complete your habit tracker every day.

Since I do Crossfit, points 2 through 4 are something I already did. Walking 8000 steps are easily achievable, as I also walk daily with my dog, Pedro (obligatory derpy pic). Rule 1 is something I've never actively done, I have set goals for myself in the past, and I would repeat them to myself in my head. But writing them down, actually makes it more ingrained in your pattern and keeps the focus on why you're doing this. My personal goal for this challenge is doing a single strict Bar Muscle-up at the end.

Honestly, what I've been struggling most with is getting enough sleep. I usually wake up around 7 in the morning. Even if I went to bed at 1AM. So, I've had to cut time short when meeting friends to get my hours of sleep, which is something I usually never did and just kind of sucked it up. I do feel this having a positive impact on my overall performance already. 

### Dungeon Crawler Carl
I've been recommended [Dungeon Crawler Carl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Crawler_Carl) and started the first book last week. I read the whole thing in a couple of days and highly recommend it to anyone. I've sang its praises to my friends left, right and center. It's such a great read, without spoiling anything, Carl suddenly finds himself in a fucked up videogame world and you following along as he is trying to wrap is head around the rules of the dungeon, getting achievements, opening lootboxes and fighting mobs. The worldbuilding is more vast than you might think at first glance. 

### Mewgenics
After 15 long years, Mewgenics finally sees the light of day. Ever since it was first announced, I was hyped for more Binding of Isaac madness in a different setting. I've played about 20 hours or so since release and will probably to a more in-depth review at some point. I've enjoyed my run with the game a lot so far. Though Dungeon Crawler Carl is taking up more of my free time, and I genuinally find it hard to put the books down (even writing this blog post is a miracle!)

### Magic the Gathering
I've recently really become more invested in Magic the Gathering, since a leave of absence of almost 20 years (with maybe a tiny relapse 8-10 years ago). I have a Pauper Tournament planned this Friday with a bunch of friends, and I'm still struggling to decide whether I'm going to play Gruul Cascade or Rakdos Madness. Both decks are very fun to play, I'll probably do some more playtesting in the next couple of days and might report back on the results of the tournament.
