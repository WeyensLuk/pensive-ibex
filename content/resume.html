    <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
    <p>
        I have a passion for puzzles and solving them. This skill serves me well as a Software Engineer, as every problem is a puzzle waiting to be solved. I still get a jolt of excitement when all the pieces fall into place.
        The challenge doesn't end with solving the puzzle for me. I also enjoy sharing knowledge with others, providing them with the necessary tools to solve their own puzzles.
        I have both architectured solutions and implemented them. Improving the design every step of the way, with a passion for test-driven development.

                Last year I was part of the team that finished second. This year we came third.

            <p class="experience">
                I coach and support colleagues over multiple teams. I have helped lay the foundations of a continuously learning mindset by setting up workshops, reading and focus groups.<br />
                I have been involved in the design and implementation of new products, from the first line of code to the first customer. I have been responsible for the architecture of the product and the implementation of the core components.<br />
                I have maintained legacy software, inspiring test-driven development mindsets and improving the design of the software. Taking the boy-scout rule by heart, making small improvements along the way.
