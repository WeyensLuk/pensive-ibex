            <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
            <p>
                I have a passion for puzzles and solving them. This skill serves me well as a Software Engineer, as every problem is a puzzle waiting to be solved. Every time the pieces fall into place and the solution is found, it is a moment of joy.
                The challenge doesn't end with solving a puzzle, I also enjoy sharing knowledge with others. Providing others with the tools to solve their own puzzles is a rewarding experience.
                I have both architectured solutions and implemented them. Improving the design every step of the way, with a passion for test-driven development.

                    <p class="experience">
                        I coach and support colleagues over multiple teams. I have helped lay the foundations of a continuously learning mindset by setting up multiple reading groups and workshops.<br />
                        I have been involved in the design and implementation of a new product, from the first line of code to the first customer. I have been responsible for the architecture of the product and the implementation of the core components.<br />
                        I have maintained legacy software, introducing a test-driven development mindset and improving the design of the software. Taking the boy-scout rule by heart, making small improvements along the way.
