Warning: I've gone back into the game to take some screenshots that I found noteworthy to mention but forgot to take at the time. So you might see me with more advanced gear than what I actually had at the time...

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/pensive-ibex.png "Meet PensiveIbex! The greatest Tinker of his time!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/silver-sapling.png "Should I die, this is where I'll come back to life. Or so the game suggests. Better not put it to the test, right?")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/jumping-puzzle.png "Ah, one of those famed jumping puzzles. I'm a great platformer, this should be easy...")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/pixel-perfect-callibration.png "How the mighty have fallen (literally). I must have done this part more than 10 times before getting a feel for it. Top tip, look down to check you have enough runway.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/ankh.png "What's this? Some kind of shrine? Couple of phrases to remember. I've jotted them down, but no use for them just now.
EDIT: Thanks Wouter! Apparently they're for levelling up. You can gain levels throughout the game, but if you don't visit a shrine, it's just bupkis")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/boss-room.png "Looks ominous! I managed to pick the key up a short while ago to open this door. I'll save my game here, just to be sure. Who knows what'll be waiting for me on the other side of the door...")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/disappointment.png "Well that was disappointing... Just a little old worm? No loot? Nothing?! Fat lot of good that key did me!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/orb.png "Ooooookay. I can look through this and see the outside? What else does it do? What am I missing?! Tell me your secrets!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/yikes.png "A river! Let's swim around a little and explore. YIKES! What's this thing? Wait... WAIT! I can't pull out my weapons in the water? Run awaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyy!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/level-up.png "That goblin didn't know what hit him! Well... They did. I hit them. Hard.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/another-boss-room.png "I'm starting to think these rooms aren't that dangerous. In fact, I'm not even going to save here. That's right, PensiveIbex the Tinker, lives life on the edge of a badly worn hand axe. Bebeh.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/floor-puzzle.png "And there's the proof in the pudding. It does look like some kind of puzzle room, or other.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/locked-secret-door.png "A secret door, eh? But I don't have a matching key for the lock. Aww... I marked it on the map, will have to circle back for it!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/grey-goblin.png "Stylish gimp suit, my grey friend. Does everybody share your fashion sense? You want me to meet your king? I'm honoured! But you know, so busy, I'll come back though. Please tell your liege not to wait up for me.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/rip-korianous.png "Another short jumping puzzle later. Which I found mechanically more tricky than the last one. Here lies Korianous. I never met him, but this spot looks wonderful for a night's rest. Don't let me keep you, mate!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/new-loot.png "Hope you don't mind me taking some of the things you left here, eh Kori old chap? No? Thought so, cheers mate! Everyone does keep going on and on about how good you are! Look at my new attire! I even have a shiny new axe, world, watch out!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/baubles.png "That golden box also had some shiny baubles in them. They might fetch a nice price somewhere. If I ever figure out how the bartering system works...")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/no-more-torch.png "Well, apparently it isn't all that smart to go to sleep with the light on. The light died during the night, and I've been walking around blind for a good couple of minutes before I realized what was going on. Luckily this whole place is littered with candles and torches. One wonders why everyone keeps those things lying around. If anything torches should be worth their weight in gold around here.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/rip-skeleton.png "While I was admiring the banner that hung up here. The battle music started, I jumped up out of my seat. My girlfriend giving me a look of surprise, as a skeleton was charging me. Quick, hurry, move out of the way! Ready arms! Aim, swing, CHARGE! Goodbye, skeleton. Such a nice cowl you have. Mine for the taking, you say? Mighty kind *tips leather cap and drops it on the floor*")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/green-goblin.png "Hey mate, I've bumped into your grey friends earlier. Want me to see your queen? Heard that before, I'll tell you the same thing I told those other guys. I'll circle back to your base. Gotta go now, bye bye!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/staircase.png "Aha! This is apparently the way down further into the abyss. I've passed a couple of goblin camps on the way here. I'll hold off going down and explore the map some more. I still have to find the human settlement and I'll have to look into the blood feud between the grey and green goblins.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/fountain.png "Mighty handy! With a click of the button we're back up to full health! Smashing. I didn't yet need it badly, but it's good knowing it is around.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/first-magic-scroll.png "Some more green goblins about, attacking me without provocation! Those green devils sure are working on my nerves. I might visit their grey brothers soon, might join hands and rid ourselves of this green menace roaming about. In other news, I've found my first spell! Although, how much use it will do me with just 2MP remains to be seen.")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/other-exit.png "Another way down? Was the other staircase a trap? Is this one a trap? Are there secrets to be found? I'm dying to find out, but there's still so much left to do on this level!")

![](/img/ultima-underworld/first-steps/jump-around.png "Looks like another platform I might be able to jump to? I'll leave it here for now. Let's see if we can jump across next time. Or even, if it's worth doing in the first place.")
