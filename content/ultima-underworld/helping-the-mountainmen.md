![](into-the-mine.png "We've dallied enough in the mountainmen's base. Time to earn our keep. Let's enter the mine and slay the creature that haunts its halls.")

![](gold-vein.png "Nice to know there's so much gold in abundance in this place. Too bad nothing I have on me lets me harvest it. I've tried the rock hammer several times in vein. Even after equipping it, it won't even register as a weapon I can swing at the vein.")

![](poisoned-by-rat.png "Damned rats. Bit me and now I'm poisoned. Only mildly, let's hope it wears off quickly. What if it doesn't wear off? Oh dear. Better save, just to be sure.")

![](friendly.png "Looks like a friendly face might reside here.")

![](shak.png "Shak, my man! I've heard so much about you! Shak Attack! The Shakinator! And great info on Cabirus. So two of the 6 talismans are a sword and a shield. Said sword is broken in two parts. Too bad I'm an axewielder.")

![](much-haggling.png "You drive a hard bargain, my friend. At least I finally got all this excellent gear. Check out my new digs. Chain mail chest piece, leggings and boots. I'm certified slash-free.")

![](waiting-for-repairs.gif "Shak, old buddy, old pal. Mind repairing my axe for me? I'm slaying this beast in these halls, and I want everything to be in tip top shape. 17 minutes? Yeah sure, I'll wait. Hold up. Are those real life minutes? Are you for real? That's my only weapon. Alright then old buddy, old pal, get comfortable. We're stuck with each other for the next 17 minutes. How's life been?")

![](torch-ran-out.png "Where has the time gone? We've been talking so long my torch ran out. Don't you worry though, I've got plenty to spare. In stark contrast to the amount of axes I have on me...")

![](excellent-axe.png "Wow, such an excellent axe! Thanks for sharpening the blade, my friend! I'll visit soon. Give my regards to the wife and kids. It's time for a face-to-face with the ol' monster and my brand spanking new axe")

![](unstable-mines.png "They sure do put up a lot of warnings, every mine is a bit unstable. What are the odds of something happening?")

![](cave-in.png "What's that behind me? Yeesh! No wonder you need a hard hat.")

![](rock-hammer.png "Lucky I brought a rock hammer with me, or I would've been stuck on this side. I'm sure Old Shak would've chuckled at the thought")

![](to-the-monster.png "This way to the monster. I have to say, the mountainmen really love their signs.")

![](clear-the-cave-in.png "Another cave-in. Must've been man-made, locking the monster in.")

![](easy-peasy.png "Nothing the rock hammer isn't able to solve.")

![](beholder.png "Behold! The beholder! I did die here on my first encounter. Had a bit of a fumble, and took too many orbs to the face. After a second attempt the beholder was no more! And there was much rejoicing.")

![](take-my-flute.png "Thank you for this gift! I'm not sure how to use it though. I am but a simple Tinker. I'll put it on my shelf, when I get home. As a reminder. But wait! I've got something for you too! This flute. Which has... Uhm... Magical properties! Once played all those near you can't help but dance a silly little jig. Go ahead, play! See, I'm dancing! Completely out of my control! Okay then, have fun with that, buh-bye now! (think he bought it?)")

![](if-your-lordship-insists.png "Okay, I'll look at your treasure room. (show-off much?)")

![](noble-dwarf-uhm.png "I'm sorry! I had no idea I wasn't allowed to say the D-word. It won't happen again, your kingship.")

![](how-inpractical.png "Why is it so far down? Why are there no stairs? Do you just throw your treasures down the pit? What if you need to repay someone? Or if you give out a loan?")

![](so-confused.png "Say one thing about Ironwit, his wit or his memory for that matter is not that sharp... Your parents really screwed up naming you.")

![](worms.png "Let it not be said of Pensive Ibex that he won't help those in need! I'll go look for your blueprints. I'm a friend to all dwa... mountainmen.")

![](follow-the-golden-path.png "Do NOT stray off the path. Death awaits.")

![](while-im-down-here.png "I found the potions at the bottom behind a locked door. But guess what else I found, these filthy creatures! *trumpets blare* Here comes Pensive Ibex to save the daaaayyyy!")

![](maybe-shak-knows.png "Since Ironwit didn't know which potion was which, I thought my pal Shak might know. He can identify things. Let's see here. Shak what can you tell me about this potion here? Well... That's kinda what I figured myself. So no help then?")

![](useless-shak.png "What about this other potion? Red, you say? Well, I can't deny it. Thanks, Shak. I'll just walk all the way back now.")

![](ankh-room.png "Did some more exploring and found the Ankh room. That's good, I gained a couple of levels slaying monsters. But I don't want to use Summ Ra anymore, that chant is too random.")

![](caved-in-stairway.png "Huh. Wonder what caused that. Might be able to clear it?")

![](grey-goblins.png "A little further down the road, I found some more of my friends. A whole bunch of them. Only two on-screen, but there were at least 5 or 6 of them in this corridor. Slashed them up good, while the others were throwing stones at me from the back.")

![](come-at-me.png "Found a fountain in the waterworks down below. And a little lurker came to say hello. Always looking, always judging.")

![](chant.png "Meh. Not really interested in upgrading my bargaining skills. I'll just wing it.")

![](another-chant.png "That's what I'm talking about! Let's get some hits in!")

![](dont-run-away-from-me.png "Don't just came at me, bite me, poison me and then run away! I'm not done with you! Get back here! Oy!")

![](big-spiders.png "Another big spider, I've just dealt with your brethren back there. Stand back and I might... HAVE AT THEE! YOU ASKED FOR THIS!")

![](new-battle-axe.png "What is this magnificent piece of equipment? This battle axe will be the bane of my enemies! I'll name it Headsplitter (for obvious reasons). On a sidenote, look at all the stuff I had to drop to make room for Headsplitter, I kept my other axe as a backup. Shak won't surprise me with his 15-minute quick repair again.")

![](what-is-here.png "I've looked all around, but I can't seem to enter this area. There's a portcullis that's closed across a bridge. The lever, which supposedly opens it, is on the other side of the gate. I've searched the rooms north of there for secret passages, but couldn't find any. Maybe it's a staircase from level 3 that goes back up here, as a kind of secret?")

![](flying-to-the-storeroom.png "Once my exploration of the current floor was done. I returned to the Golden Path to help Ironwit find his blueprints. Now I just have to figure out which potion is which. If I were to brew two potions, one flying, one poison and leave them in a room, which would be which? Since green is often associated with poison, I'd think people would assume the red one to be safe. So that means the green one is actually the flying potion, let's try that! Hooray! It works!")

![](blueprints-found.png "And there are the blueprints! Excellent! Let's get them back to Ironwit. I wonder what they are for?")

![](what-a-drop.png "D'oh. My flying potion ran out. There's no way to get across anymore. I'll just have to bite the bullet and hope I won't break any bones.")

![](no-broken-bones.png "That did hardly any damage at all. You would think with all this gear on me, I would land harder. Maybe my bed roll broke the fall?")

![](remember-my-name.png "I'll have you know many dw... mountainmen have heard of me! I am Pensive Ibex! Remember me!")

![](on-to-level-3.png "Not much else to do here, onwards to the next floor!")
