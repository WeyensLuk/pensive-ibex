![](puddle.png "I just got down here and now my feet are wet! I sure hope I won't die of a cold in this place.")

![](poisoned.png "Not only am I wet, now I'm also poisoned! Stupid thorny plants. I'm still puzzled why my arms are exposed. Shouldn't this mail shirt cover everything? What piece of gear am I missing?")

![](did-i-just-guess-the-code.png "What luck! I tried a code and as luck would have it, the gate just opened! Not sure what I would've done if it failed, would that passage just close off forever?")

![](bandit.png "It seems I have picked up some of that intolerance to rudeness. Have at thee, foul knave!")

![](old-man-sleepy-times.png "After that battle with the bandit and suffering all that poison damage, it's time to lay out my bedroll and enjoy a night's sleep. My dreams are haunted by this old man, urging me on to collect Cabirus' talismans. But I'm on a quest to save a princess! Why should I care about Cabirus?")

![](arms-at-the-ready.png "Friend or foe? I'm not to be trifled with!")

![](hail-lizardman.png "I have no idea what you're saying, but you seem friendly enough. You almost seemed like one of those monsters I passed, except you still have your head on your shoulders.")

![](prisoner.png "A mute wizard locked in a cell by these lizardman? Let's see if we can figure out what is going on.")

![](learning-lizardspeak.png "So it appears this guy understands lizardspeak and can mime the meaning of any word to me. So bit by bit I'm going back and forth between this wizard and his captor in order to piece together the story of what happened.")

![](freed.png "Apparently this naughty little boy, stole some food of the lizardmen. He was on death row for his offense. A bit harsh if you ask me. But since having a wizard owing me a favour surely is a good thing, I returned some food to the lizardmen from my own stash. Don't tell them the chicken legs are already 3 days old. Remember Pensive Ibex, great wizard! (Although I'm not sure what good a wizard could do me, that can't even free himself from this cell...)")

![](misty.png "More exploring from the base of the lizardmen. A large river runs through this section, filled with plenty of misty clouds.")

![](such-big-teeth-you-have.png "Whenever there's water, there surely are lurkers about. Good thing they have the ill sense to come near to shore, so my axe can do the talking.")

![](caved-in.png "This seems to be the caved-in-stairway from the upper floor. Slowly filling out the map of this floor.")

![](someone-tripped-here.png "Either someone tripped so badly they fell out of their armour, or a lurker had a little snack and coughed up the indigestible pieces.")

![](another-rotworm.png "Another one of these rotworms. It strange seeing these lowly critters around these parts. I'm used to dealing with beholders and big spiders! Get away from me, anklebiters!")

![](lever.png "I pulled it. Nothing happened. Rather something probably did happen, but I have no idea what or where.")

![](mongbat.png "Flying monkeys? What's next? Pigmen?")

![](ankh.png "Time to cash in that experience with the new RA chant I learned. My attack skilled bumped up from 19 to 29. Headsplitter grins in my hands.")

![](more-bandits.png "Have you come to test my new abilities? *slash*! *swish*! *crunch*! I'll reduce you to a pile of blood!")

![](tom-loves-judy.png "How sweet! Lovers in the abyss. That's a good name for a band. Where did I leave my flute?")

![](magic-crystal.png "Now this seems interesting! How do I get my hands on this Magic Crystal?")

![](grey-lizardman.png "There's more of you? If there are red, green and grey lizardman, does that mean I still have to meet red goblins? Does it work that way?")

![](search-for-ossikka.png "From up close you look awfully white there friend. Not so grey, rather albino. Are you ill? Anyway, I shall look for your leader and will report back soon. Any information about this place is good to know.")

![](window.png "A window is a bit of a stretch, isn't it?")

![](nothing-much-to-see.png "Not sure why they even put it here. Not a great view. One star out of five, asked for oceanside view, got black darkness.")

![](tried-this-lever.png "Someone surely died pulling this lever. I shouldn't pull it. I really really shouldn't. The evidence is right here. Why am I even entertaining the thought? I'm gonna pull it. I have to. It's an adventurer's nightmare not to pull a lever. Okay, I pulled it. Nothing happened. AGAIN. Which is an adventurer's second greatest nightmare! Or did that other lever nullify the bad effects of this lever? Sigh...")

![](thieves-hideout.png "Behind some big spiders I find this little pile of loot, which tells me the thieves' hideout is behind the storage room. I passed the Western and Eastern storage room when that rude bandit turned me away. I'll visit it later.")

![](key-for-bandit-camp.png "So I'm guessing I can spin the disc around to either create a key for the Eastern or Western storage rooms? Intricate design!")

![](key-to-your-fortitude.png "Fine words. But what do they mean? This level sure has been filled with signs that have been scratched out in awkward locations.")

![](zak.png "Hail Zak! How goes it? Did you realize that if I had a speech impediment your name sounds an awful lot like a dwarf I know?")

![](luminous.png "You're weird, dude. Thanks for showing me, but I'm not really interested. I've got plenty torches on me. But hey, if I ever run out, you're the guy I'm coming to. Zak the Illuminator. Sounds good, think about it.")

![](beholder.png "This must be the creature Ossikka wanted to slay! It must be the brother of the beholder I slayed down in the dwarven mines (sorry, mountainmen). I have experience with your kind, I won't be as easy a target as I once was!")

![](not-the-book-i-am-looking-for.png "Hm... Not what I was expecting. I was looking for a book that would provide more information on Cabirus' sword. Not a useless chant. Does that mean the creature Ossikka was sent to slay is even more fearsome than the beholder? What say you, Headsplitter? Are you as excited as I am?")

![](there-it-is.png "I found the book. I didn't even capture the monster that was guarding it. I'll tell you. It was a rat... Ossikka, the leader of the lizardmen, was slain by a rat. I hoped for more. At least I found the book. And apparently there's a rift between the grey lizards and the red and green ones. What Ossikka gone, who will take up the mantle?")

![](sword-location.png "The ghastly ones have the haft and the blade is hidden in the southeast of this floor? I haven't even been able to get there. I see more exploring in the near future. Let's head back to Ishtass to tell him the news.")

![](sword-info.png "I had to go back a bunch of times... I had to bring proof of Ossikka's demise. Upon bringing the book, Ishtass was not convinced. Bringing the piece of scroll from Cabirus adressed to Ossikka did finally convince him. And more information (though not much) about the sword was granted! A wizard took a piece below? Would that be the same wizard I freed? That would be rather handy. I'll find out soon. Let's go look for the blade first.")
