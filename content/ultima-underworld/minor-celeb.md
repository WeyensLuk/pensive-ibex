Warning: I did a kernel update this weekend, since then any fullscreen application displays major stuttering. I've since downgraded my system again and everything's working as it should be, but this session was played in windowed mode. Hence, why some screenshots may look different from the ones before.

![](leeches.png "What's on the other side? Just a bunch of leeches... Yuck! Just boring platform then?")

![](lurker.png "Oh wait, there's this guy too. Quite literally lurking. Wait. Are you judging me? Go bother some other adventurers! I'm outta here.")

![](mysterious-door.png "A little further there's this door I noticed just now. Just across the chasm. I've got some experience jumping gaps, this should be a cinch!")

![](another-way-down.png "More than 10 reloads later, I finally managed to clear the gap. Guess I found another way down. That's the third staircase, so far. But I'm not ready to go down yet. I guess that means I have to cross the gap again. Sigh.")

![](summ-ra-summ-ra.png "Okay, since I was exploring some more, I came back to the ankh room in order to capitalize on the levels I gained defeating slimes and goblins. 5 chants of Summ Ra later and my Axe skill went up with 1. I had some luck with Defense, but I wonder how useful it is, they do say Offense is the best Defense.")

![](queen-retichall.png "Time to enter the grey goblin camp. I found the queen and asked permission to talk to her husband, she was quickly led around the bush by my charming self. It's the bushy beard that gives me some bonus charisma.")

![](other-side-of-secret-door.png "Remember the locked secret door I found in the last session? Well this is the other side of it. Guess I now know it leads to the heart of the grey goblin camp. Not that I really need it, since they just opened the front door for me.")

![](bragits-great-escape.png "I didn't post about Bragit in the previous session. He's the first human I met in the dungeon and told me how he escaped his cell in the grey goblin camp, by using a pole. Not quite sure how, though. The ceilings are pretty low here...")

![](dangerous-privy.png "Best not take go the shitter here, it might be the last visit I take. Splash! Aiiieeee! Gone gone gone.")

![](aforementioned-dangerous-privy.png "Talk about a hole in the ground.")

![](keep-out-grey.png "Large keep out sign and no way to open it. I guess the king might be carrying a key? Or someone around here might. If things turn south, I might get something out of it. If I live to tell the tale.")

![](king-ketchaval.png "I guess it's obvious how this guy thinks about his green brothers. Not much else interesting to say, so I'll take my leave.")

![](obnoxious-retichall.png "Sheesh! I'm sorry I wanted to strike up a conversation. I thought maybe you had something else to say. You know, talk about your day. But fine, I get the message. I'll get out of your way. I'm starting to like these grey goblins less and less. Let's hop in to see the greener variety.")

![](green-goblins.png "Wow. Such warm welcome. Much hospitality.")

![](maffia-vibes.png "What is this? New York in the 40s?")

![](da-boss.png "After pampering this guy and choosing my words very carefully, he finally opened up. Only to hear this guy go on about King Ketchaval. I guess they really don't like each other.")

![](da-boss2.png "Okay, so I know a little more about the other inhabitants of the abyss. The first part is about the lizardmen. And I learned my first two words. Now I'll just guess whether Sseth is yes or no.")

![](da-boss3.png "So maybe the keep out door has one of those talismans? Maybe I'll have to break in after all...")

![](keep-out-green.png "Another keep out door. This time in the green goblin camp. They're not that different from each other after all...")

![](mine-entrance.png "After talking to the green goblins and basically getting no motivation to do something about the greys or the greens from either side, I decided to leave them in their hate for each other and continue my journey down. I took the entrance I discovered in this session and bumped into a mine entrance. It didn't seem wise to journey into the mine, apparently you need a hard hat. I only have a hard head. Ey-yo!")

![](two-slimes.png "Turning to the right, I find a room with two slimes. I grab my axe, and make short work of them.")

![](nice-crown.png "Who leaves a crown lying around? Why were those two slimes guarding this crown? Maybe I should declare myself king. King of the misunderstood.")

![](skeletons.png "The room on the other side of the slime room contains two living skeletons. Now that's more like it. Swing and hit and swing and hit.")

![](backdoor-mountainmen.png "I found a key lying around that fits this door. Since there're banners on either side of the door, this must be another settlement. I wonder who I'll meet! (Please no more goblins)")

![](minor-celeb.png "Why, yes, yes I am Pensive Ibex. Slayer of slimes. Scourge of skeletons. Gasher of goblins and walloper of worms. What, pray tell, might I do you for?")

![](fearsome-beast.png "A fearsome beast, eh? Well, I can't turn down a challenge like that. I WILL find this beast. And I WILL slay it with mine own two hands. And my axe.")

![](goldthirst.png "I wonder how you got your name. Did your parents give it to you? Were you redubbed at some point? What's your story, man?!")

![](goldthirst2.png "I will slay the beast! This will be the last you have seen of the Menace in the Mines. I shall set forth, hencewith! After I do some more exploring. You see I found this key that seems to open your locked doors, and I'm curious to have a look around. Surely, you don't mind? The beast has terrorized the mines for so long, what's a couple more hours, eh? Agreed, then? Huzzah!")

![](staircase-lvl3.png "Behind one of these locked doors in the hall of the mountainmen is a staircase down. Might be a direct connection to a deeper level of mountainmen?")

![](foiled.png "At least it doesn't have a sign that tells me to keep out. So if I find a way to get in, I'm allowed? That's how it works, right?")

![](partake-freely.png "I will partake freely from the supply room that's been kept behind lock and key. Thank you very much. Goodbye.")

![](corby.png "So does that mean I shouldn't murder the grey/green goblins? Perhaps there's a way to reconcile? We'll see. I'm determined to find out what's behind those locked doors at some point.")
